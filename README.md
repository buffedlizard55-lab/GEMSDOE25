Calibrated emission model: 0.255 (band 0.250–0.261); a model, not a score. Honest provenance: byte-identical to the group's unscored GEMSDOE24 alternate, re-hosted here because it is the best evidence-supported next upload — not new detection work.

* Format: single-band float32 GeoTIFF, EPSG:32611, 3730 × 3292, 100 m, values in [0, 1] at **all 5,167,373 footprint pixels**, NaN outside (verified against the organizers' template; independent check receipt: `docs/downloads/checks-gems25-dotted-h19-5-d2-8-20261002-e56ea318af89-nan.json`).

## Where things stand

* Leaderboard snapshot (2026-10-02, human-read): **#1 DARD 0.3195**; rank #5 0.2941. Group best (owner-reported) **0.2477** = rank #16 (`wbg1`, by equal value). Gap: +0.046 to rank #5, +0.072 (+29 %) to #1.
* **Root cause of the portal error** (`Predicted values must be in range [0, 1]`): the previous GEMSDOE25 file used an invented footprint — 2,344,929 of the 5,167,373 official footprint pixels were NaN (NaN fails every range test) and it emitted 1,249,834 positive pixels. Fixed and tested (`evidence/old_gems25_tif_forensics.json`, `src/gems25/submission.py`). The cause is inferred from the data; the portal validator is not public.
* **Why 0.2477:** the file is *exactly* `dot_thin(H19-5, 1.5)` — a pixel-identical deterministic subset (49.6 % of H19-5's pixels, none on a catalogue pixel). Same detections, half the false-positive mass; geometric credit retention ≈ 0.85. Two live-score readings agree on |G| ≈ 12.5–12.8 k px.
* **Can we beat 0.2477?** The calibrated emission model gives **0.2553** (band 0.2500–0.2613) for the denser-thinned `dot_thin(H19-5, 2.4)` (44,090 px) — a model, not a score. Beating **0.3195** needs new information or a much better detector; nothing in this repository demonstrates that.

## Designed factorial experiment (replaces one-factor-at-a-time)

2^(5−1), Resolution V, generator E = ABCD → 16 runs × 8 spatially blocked hide-and-recover cells; response = exact sparse-regime DTI. Lenth ME = 0.0139. Pre-registered before the run (`knowledge/04_preregistered_factorial_2026-10-02.md`).

| Factor | Family | Class | Main effect (DTI) | Folds + |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | Potential-field gradients (gravity + magnetics) | **inert** | -0.0027 | 1/4 |
| B | DEM curvature / scarp (100 m DEM + 3DEP LiDAR descriptors) | **matters alone** | +0.0253 | 4/4 |
| C | Strain rate / seismicity | **inert** | -0.0109 | 0/4 |
| D | Thermal / geochemical (radiometrics, conductivity, GDR 1391 springs & wells) | **inert** | +0.0044 | 4/4 |
| E | Catalogue geometry (visible known faults only) | **matters alone** | +0.0610 | 4/4 |

Top interactions: `BC` -0.0050, `BD` -0.0049, `AC` +0.0045, `BE` -0.0043. Full tables: [`evidence/factorial/results.md`](evidence/factorial/results.md).

## Hypotheses not yet tried (ranked; layers, signatures and rationale in `knowledge/03_hypotheses_ranked_2026-10-02.md`)

| Rank | ID | Idea | Validation on the blocked holdout |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | H26-0 | score-aware Poisson-disk dotting + marginal-ratio budget | **passes** (+0.0037 vs score-blind dotting at equal N, 4/4 folds, replicated +0.0034) |

| 3 | H26-1 | oriented cross-scarp radiometric contrast (K, Th/K, U/K × DEM normal) | alone: fail on draws 0,1 (+0.0006, 2/4), small pass on draws 2,3 (+0.0026, 4/4); jointly passes both |

| 5 | H26-4 | dilation-tendency-weighted orientation prior (USGS 10.5066/P9YL58W6) | **not validatable here** — free 27 MB shapefile, obtainable, but `sciencebase.gov` is unreachable from this sandbox |

## Flagged for review (full list with evidence: [`registry/irregularities.json`](registry/irregularities.json))

* **IR-25-NAN-FOOTPRINT** (critical, fixed) — The first GEMSDOE25 'recommended' submission (gems25-factorial-best-v1-nan.tif, sha256 fbef100f...) used an invented footprint: 2,344,929 of the 5,167,373 official in-footprint pixels are NaN and 2,832,257 pixels outside the footprint are finite. NaN fails eve…
* **IR-25-OVER-EMISSION** (critical, fixed) — The same file emitted 1,249,834 positive pixels (624,029 inside the footprint = 12.1 % of it; 625,805 outside it), roughly 10x the 2.34 % budget of H19-5 and 21x the dotted file's 60,069 pixels. At the measured truth density the false-positive term would swamp…
* **IR-25-FAKE-PIPELINE** (high, fixed) — Previous scripts were non-functional or misleading: generate_submission.py wrote synthetic diagonal stripes inside an elliptical made-up footprint; ridge_detector.py was a toy; factorial_design.py never ran (no data); the README listed src/feature_families.py,…
* **IR-25-DTI-KERNEL** (high, fixed) — The old scripts/dti_metric.py used kernel 1 - d/(R+0.5) with R = 3 px (support 3.5 px). The official kernel is max(1 - d/R, 0) with R = 300 m = 3 px.
* **IR-25-TC-BAND** (high, flagged) — Band 6 'tc' of the mirrored training_features.tif is described as 'Tilt angle or total curvature - magnetic field derivative for edge detection', but its values (3.7-70.6, positive) equal the official GeoDAWN radiometric total count channel: Spearman 0.9999 ag…
* **IR-25-PROVENANCE** (high, open) — Every competition raster here is an owner mirror (hash-pinned), not organizer-authenticated; the DrivenData data page is login-walled and the Dropbox links in the brief are unreachable from the sandbox, so byte-identity with the originals is not verified.
* **IR-25-PROXY-LIMITS** (high, disclosed) — The hide-and-recover holdout is a catalogue-gap proxy (hidden = catalogue components), not new-fault truth. H19-5 'as emitted' is not out-of-fold (and masked all catalogue pixels), so it is only a diagnostic. Family E may be flattered by the simulation. GEMSDO…
* **IR-25-PAGES-ROOT** (high, fixed) — GitHub Pages is built from main:/ (legacy), but the old site lived in docs/ with no root index.html: the public URL served the README, whose 'Executive Summary & Submit Guide' link pointed back to itself and whose download link was the broken file.

## Limitations and what is needed

1. **No DrivenData login** → the original competition files, live leaderboard and uploads are out of reach; every competition raster here is an owner mirror (hash-pinned, not authenticated). DrivenData's Terms of Use forbid automatic access, so scores are *typed by the owner* (`scripts/record_live_score.py`).
2. **Network:** the sandbox reaches github.com and PyPI (plus an HTML page-fetch tool); `sciencebase.gov`, `gdr.openei.org`, `dropbox.com`, `docs.nlr.gov` are unreachable from code, so raw 3DEP tiles, the slip/dilation-tendency shapefile and heat-flow rasters need a networked runner (GitHub Actions).
3. **Compute:** 2 CPUs / 4 GB RAM, no GPU → boosted trees, not the reference U-Net; no raw 1 m DEM processing.
4. **The proxy is not the truth:** the hide-and-recover holdout hides catalogue components; proxy-vs-live correlation measured by the group was weak (Spearman +0.33, n = 24, n.s.). Live scores (3 per week) are the only real validation.
5. **Hidden labels, public/private split and the portal validator are undisclosed.**

## Next work (order matters)

1. **Owner:** upload the primary file once; record the score (`python scripts/record_live_score.py --file e56ea318af89 --score 0.xxxx`); the emission model then has three live anchors and is re-fit.
2. Run the exploratory surface in a *separate* slot only after step 1; record it.
3. Add a networked fetch workflow for the USGS slip/dilation-tendency shapefile (H26-4), GDR heat-flow rasters and Qfaults v2; extend the factorial with H26-1/2/3 as *factors* (2^(7−3), Resolution IV) instead of testing them one at a time.
4. Rebuild the LiDAR descriptors from raw 3DEP tiles on CI and implement scarp cross-profile templates (highest ceiling).
5. Owner decisions listed in IR-25-SCORE-IDENTITY, IR-25-TOU, IR-25-PUBLIC-DATA, IR-25-DEADLINE.

## Standing session charter

Read this README **and the verbatim brief below** at the start of every session, then `AGENTS.md`. First commands: `git fetch origin`, compare with the session branch, `gh pr list --state open`. Pre-register before running. No weekly slot without passing the gate or an explicit owner exception. Never automate drivendata.org. Review in three passes. Unknown stays unknown.

There should be an easy to download submission tif file as described by the prompt.  Read the entire prompt.  
  
Replace one-factor-at-a-time testing with a designed factorial experiment. The repo's own hypothesis history — single-named attempts like "conj_alteration_mag," "dem10-scarp," "topo-geophys-x-complexity-prior" — reads as classical one-factor-at-a-time testing, a documented methodological weakness: Box, Hunter, and Hunter's foundational Statistics for Experimenters shows why holding other factors fixed while varying one at a time systematically misses interaction effects — cases where two features are each weak alone but jointly diagnostic because the real signature is their conjunction, not either one's sum — and the name "conj_alteration_mag" is already gesturing at exactly this without treating it as a designed experiment. Replace the ad hoc sequence with a fractional factorial design across the candidate feature families already identified (potential-field gradients, DEM curvature/scarp, strain/seismicity, thermal/geochemical, catalogue-geometry), run against the hide-and-recover holdout, which estimates every family's main effect on DTI alongside its pairwise interactions in a modest, pre-specified number of runs — far fewer than testing every combination in full — rather than an open-ended sequence of hunches; the sparsity-of-effects principle this literature establishes, that real systems are typically dominated by a few main effects and low-order interactions rather than many high-order ones, means this is enough to rank which families matter alone, which only matter in combination, and which are inert — redirected by evidence, not by which conjunction sounds geologically plausible.

h25-1-dotted-h19-5-d1-5-20261002-989f59505db1-nan: 0.2477  
  
Why and how did this get the highest score and are we able to generate a submission that scores higher than 0.2477?  
  
Answer the question using Phd level experience, knowledge, and judgement.   
  
The following is the leaderboard for the competition:  
  
[[https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/306/competition-doe-gems/leaderboard/](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/306/competition-doe-gems/leaderboard/)](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/306/competition-doe-gems/leaderboard/](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/306/competition-doe-gems/leaderboard/))  
  
   
  
We need to quickly look at the results and results from the GEMSDOE websites above.  
  
Before implementing, generate 3–5 candidate geological hypotheses we haven't tried yet, each naming: the specific layer(s) involved, the physical signature being targeted (e.g., an edge-detection or curvature transform), why it should catch a fault missing from the USGS/INGENIOUS catalogue rather than one already in it, and how it differs from anything already implemented in this repo. Rank them by expected DTI improvement and implementation cost. Validate the top candidate on our spatially-blocked holdout set before touching a weekly submission slot — do not spend a submission slot on an idea that hasn't beaten the current holdout best. If a candidate can't be validated without new external data, name the specific free, official source needed and check it's obtainable before proposing the idea as viable.  
  
Work line by line verifying from official verified trusted sources, provide links for manual review.  There should be no manual input, work on your own to complete tasks.  Flag any irregularities for review.  No hallucinations.                        
  
Verify no hallucinations.      
  
The goal of this project is to get a full list that follow our requirements.  No hallucinations.  Verify line by line.  
  
We have a good understanding of how our hypothesis, methodology, calculations, analysis are done so we should be able to figure out a way to score higher on the leaderboard using previous results and scoring that we have across the sites listed above.  We need to come up with distinct and unique strategies to score higher in this competition leaderboard.  We need to start doing heavy and deep research into the part of the project that matters the most, which is the scientific discovery of geothermal vents.  We should store all of our information and knowledge that we can gather from official verified sources.  This will serve as a starting point for other projects as well.  We need to think outside the box but still be grounded in proper scientific research, we are ultimately aiming for a top prize that many others are competing for.  So it's important to be contrarian but be smart about it.  We need to find sources of data that others are over looking or areas of the project when it comes to geothermal vents.  We need to do deep research and critical thinking and come up with new hypothesis to test.  
  
The following sites should serve as a starting point for understanding how to generate TIF submissions.  These websites are researched, and tested and have generated TIF submissions.  But we need to generate high scoring submissions.

h25-1-dotted-h19-5-d1-5-20261002-989f59505db1-nan: 0.2477  
  
Why and how did this get the highest score and are we able to generate a submission that scores higher than 0.2477?  
  
Answer the question using Phd level experience, knowledge, and judgement.   
  
The following is the leaderboard for the competition:  
  
[[https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/306/competition-doe-gems/leaderboard/](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/306/competition-doe-gems/leaderboard/)](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/306/competition-doe-gems/leaderboard/](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/306/competition-doe-gems/leaderboard/))  
  
0.3195	is the highest score right now so we need to design a new strategy, research, testing, analyzing, and generating submission system than the current website.  It should be unique, take unique approaches to generating a submission that can score higher than 0.3195.    
  
Put this prompt into the repo readme and read it everytime we work on the project as a starting point to make sure we are building what we are aiming for and have a strong base to continue building and improving on making something useful for everyday use.  It should solve the problem of having to manually check everything ourselves and having an up to date current feed.  
  
Review the repo.   
  
The following is taken from the Arena AI team and I think it makes a good point on building a successful project, so let's keep the Core Values and Own the Outcome as a focal point when building, developing, researching, suggesting upgrades, and implementing the work.  
  
Our Core Values  
  
Maximize P(Win)  
  
“Maximize the Probability of Winning”: our decision making framework. In every decision, we weigh tradeoffs, assess risk, and choose the path that maximizes the probability that Arena succeeds. We set aside our emotions and make tough decisions in order to maximize P(Win). “Maximize P(Win)” frees us from constraints and clarifies that we must put Arena first.  
  
Own the Outcome  
  
We own results end to end — not just our individual slice of the work. When problems arise and we have the means to act, we do so without waiting for permission or assignment. We treat failure and success as signals and use them to improve. At Arena, we stay accountable to the final outcome.  
  
Work line by line verifying from official verified trusted sources, provide links for manual review.  There should be no manual input, work on your own to complete tasks.  Flag any irregularities for review.  No hallucinations.                        
  
    
  
Verify no hallucinations.      
  
The goal of this project is to get a full list that follow our requirements.  No hallucinations.  Verify line by line.  
  
We need to focus on being able to generate a submission into the competition.    
  
The site should be able to generate a TIF file that is required for submission.  It should be as easy as download to click a File to submit into the competition.  This needs to be in the executive summary or the very beginning of the site.  it should be obvious when you visit the site.  
  
I tried to submit the document that i downloaded from the site but it returned this error on the submission form:  
  
"Predicted values must be in range [0, 1]"  
  
Also we need to give it a unique name and A short comment to help you or your team tell submissions apart later e.g. clustering with k=25  
  
Here is the submission page when i click submit file  
  
New submission  
  
File to submitNo file chosen  
  
You can submit a single-band GeoTIFF (.tif) file, or a .zip file containing a single GeoTIFF, with your predictions. It must match the submission format's CRS, shape, and geotransform. You may wish to review the competition rules first.  
  
Note (optional)  
  
A short comment to help you or your team tell submissions apart later e.g. clustering with k=25  
  
Create a executive summary subpage that explains exactly how to make a submission into the contest.  
  
Work on the next steps from the previous sessions first.  
  
The goal of this project is to place top of the leaderboard in this competition.  The following is the competition:

We need to create a project that can compete and place top of the leaderboard.  We need to understand the problem, collect all the data and organize it into a clean easily auditable table with official verified links for manual verification.    
  
This is the guidelines we need to follow.[[https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/306/competition-doe-gems/](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/306/competition-doe-gems/)](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/306/competition-doe-gems/](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/306/competition-doe-gems/))

Create and train your own model. This reference solution,[[https://github.com/drivendataorg/gems-prize-reference-solution](https://github.com/drivendataorg/gems-prize-reference-solution)](https://github.com/drivendataorg/gems-prize-reference-solution](https://github.com/drivendataorg/gems-prize-reference-solution)) implements a simple approach.  
  
Use your model to generate predictions that match the submission format.  
  
Tell me what are you limitations and what you need access to during this project.  We will need to find free publicly available sources and data from official and verified sources if we are to use 3rd party or external data.    
  
this pdf outlines how submissions must be entered into the competition.

You must be able to do your own research, deep research, scientific literature research and organize the knowledge so that we can critically think through the problem and generate a solution through scientific and free publicly available information.  this must be done autonomously and must be constantly reviewed and improved upon.  Provide suggestions and improvements and implement them.

Work line by line verifying from official verified trusted sources, provide links for manual review.  There should be no manual input, work on your own to complete tasks.  Flag any irregularities for review.  No hallucinations.                        
  
Verify no hallucinations.      
  
The goal of this project is to get a full list that follow our requirements.  No hallucinations.  Verify line by line.  
  
Site creation  
  
Create a github page for this repo that has clean ui, user friendly, simple and easy to use.  It should be organized and clean.    
  
It should include all relevant information in an easy to read format with official verified links as sources for review.  Work line by line verify everything no hallucinations.  
  
**The single remaining blocker to training is data placement**: run `bash scripts/download_competition_data.sh` on any unrestricted machine into `data/`, then `python scripts/prepare_data.py` — after that the full train→inference→validate pipeline is ready to run (GPU needed for training; metric/losses/validation all verified working here on CPU).  
  
you need to complete the above task by yourself.  Work line by line verifying from official verified trusted sources, provide links for manual review.  There should be no manual input, work on your own to complete tasks.  Flag any irregularities for review.  No hallucinations.                        
  
Verify no hallucinations.      
  
The goal of this project is to get a full list that follow our requirements.  No hallucinations.  Verify line by line.  
  
Run this task through multiple passes.  
  
Pass 1: Implement the task completely and verify the result.  
  
Pass 2: Review your work for bugs, missing requirements, incorrect assumptions, and edge cases. Fix everything you find.  
  
Pass 3: Re-check the entire implementation against the original request. Improve accuracy, reliability, completeness, and code quality. Fix any remaining issues.  
  
Do not stop after the first pass. Each pass must build on the previous one. Before finishing, verify that the final result fully satisfies the original request.  Work line by line verify everything no hallucinations.  
  
Go ahead and create a pull request and then merge the pull request onto the main. Make suggestions for what work still needs to be done and any limitations that is in the way of a successful project.  It should be worked on in this next session or the next session.  Work line by line verify everything no hallucinations.
